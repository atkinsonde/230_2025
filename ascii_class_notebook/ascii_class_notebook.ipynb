We can compare coding to opening a dataset using a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet we can see the data in the cells. However, the data still have to be in a format that excel understands. Some are simple: excel understands a csv file and automatically gives a separate cell for each value between commas on each row. That seems pretty straightforward because you can just , but excel is still undergoing a process of *importing* the data so it is compatible with its format. It is less obvious because we can still see all the data in the sheet.\n","\n","\n","We need to convert our dataset into a format that python understands. By \"understanding\" I mean a format that it can operate its functions with. Data that we convert, or read in, is assigned to a variable. Recall that this is a process whereby python opens up a space in memory, reserves it, and gives it the name that we just gave it. This is what \"reading\" means, and what all of these \"read_XXX()\" functions do in pandas - they convert different file types into a form python can understand.\n","\n","\n","From there, we can now do all our stats, plots, and analyses on the data stored in the new variable.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9j0fMis1pPHZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Mount class files to your COLAB drive\n","Here is how to get files into your colab so you can refer to them in your code.
